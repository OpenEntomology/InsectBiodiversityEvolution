Given this paper - http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biw043 - perhaps we need a natural history exercise.

(0) Student thinks about his/her interests, the kinds of habitats s/he wants to spend time in

(1) Students talk with partner about these ideas, solicits feedback, perhaps refines his/her approach to observe insects

(2) In field student throws down a 4 m2 frame and spends 4 hours observing/collecting/documenting the insects in it.

(3) Student then moves to different habitat and does the same thing.

(4) After 2 or 3 iterations student medidates on these observations, discusses them with partner, then chooses 2 or 3 (or 1?) observations s/he wants to develop knowledge on.

(5) The specimens from those key observations get determined to species, there is some literature search, and development of a presentation that is given eventually to the group.

(6) To complement this initial collection, which likely has low diversity relative to all possible insects that occur in PA, students dip into bulk samples taken from similar habitats (e.g., a Malaise trap set up in same meadow for a week). They each need to pull out insects that represent 20 families they didn't observe during their exercise.

(7) The entire collection and raw field notes are turned in, and the stories are presented to the class
