\section*{Introduction}
\textbf{Amphiesmenoptera} comprises two familiar orders, Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies; covered in section 1) and Trichoptera (caddisflies; section 2), whose close relationship is uncontroversial. To open this unit we'll discuss the evolutionary significance of two characteristics shared by these insects: silk production (from the labium) and possession of setiferous wings.

%All families we cover in lab are classified in the suborder \textbf{Glossata}, the lepidopterans that possess, at least ancestrally (lost in some groups), a coilable proboscis.

\section*{Materials}
\begin{itemize}
\item specimens (provided)
\item fine forceps, probes (provided)
\item sorting tray, watch glasses, gloves, safety glasses, glycerine, ethanol (provided)
\item pencil/paper for sketches
\end{itemize}

\section*{Safety}
We will be working with sharp tools and insects on pins. Wear your personal protective gear at all times. Specimens are to be returned to their vials after lab, and glycerine and ethanol will be collected for proper disposal or reuse.

\section*{Methods}
Working with a partner, organize your space, specimens, tools, and microscope. Use your probe and forceps to manipulate the specimen. In this lab, however, we will not be dissecting specimens (unless otherwise noted). Wing venation is especially useful, and one can see these characters more clearly by placing one or two drops of ethanol on the wing. The wing color and pattern should remain unchanged after the ethanol evaporates. You can start anywhere in the handout.

\section{Lepidoptera}

\noindent{}\textbf{Lepidoptera} is one of the ``big four'' orders of insects, and with \textgreater157,000 described species and at least 350,000, probably many more, remaining to be described. These insects are commonly referred to as moths and butterflies, and they remain one of the most recognizable groups of insects. Family-level diagnostics can be difficult, however, given that many characters are obscured by scales. The vast majority of species feed on plants as larvae (caterpillars), and adults live on liquid diets, imbibed through coiled, siphon-like mouthparts (proboscis, formed from the galeae). In adults, the hind wings of most species (\textit{i.e.}, the taxon Heteroneura) are of a different shape (usually shorter and more rounded) and venation than the fore wings.

\subsection*{Big picture questions}
\noindent{}What factors contribute to the overall diversity of Lepidoptera? Can you describe one or two characteristics that could be key innovations or opportunities? \\

%not sure I get this question ==> \noindent{}Dytrisian taxa exhibit enormous diversity of larval integumentary modifications. Why are larvae of non-dytrisian generally less distinct? \\

\noindent{}Can you provide  two examples of antipredator adaptations, related to the modified wing setae? \\

\noindent{}What are the precursors of tympana? Do you think the ``ears'' on different body regions in different lepidopterans are homologous? \\ 

\noindent{}What trends do we see across the phylogeny of Lepidoptera, with respect to feeding biology, mouthpart morphology, and wing morphology? \\

\noindent{}Familiarize yourself with the following taxon names, which refer to organisms you are likely to encounter in the northeastern USA and/or which are phylogenetically relevant. Can you describe how these arthropods live (natural history) and roughly how diverse they are? Do you know how they're related to one another? If you had to choose a family to study from the taxa below which one would it be and why?

\begin{enumerate} 
\item Amphiesmenoptera
\item Ditrysia
\item Rhopalocera
\item Micropterigidae
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-dytrisian Lepidoptera (``Monotrysia'')}
There is one family of commonly encountered moths whose species exhibit a single opening at the apex of its abdomen (through which copulation, oviposition, and defecation occur).

\subsubsection{Nepticulidae (serpentine leafminer moths)}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} Wingspan 3.5--10 mm, among the very smallest of moths; usually black and white, with a metallic band or gold speckles; \textbf{antennae with an eye cap}; maxillary palps well developed, long and folded; fore wing with branched veins.\\

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} Larvae make thin, winding mines on the leaves of trees and shrubs. There are roughly 800 described species.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Dytrisia}
The remaining lepidopterans, \textgreater98\% of all species, are classified in an unranked (sometimes a ``division''), monophyletic taxon called Ditrysia. These insects have separate openings for copulation, oviposition, and defecation.

\subsubsection{Gracillariidae (blotch leafminer moths)}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} Minute to small in size (wingspan 5--20 mm); often brightly colored or metallic; maxillary palps usually absent;  proboscis bare; wing venation reduced and elongate proximally, wing fringe long; hind wing lanceolate.\\

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} Most species develop as leaf miners on trees. Some species exhibit hypermetamorphosis, with early instars (flattened body shape, piercing mouthparts) feeding on sap and late instars (tubular body shape, chewing mouthparts) feeding on tissues.

\subsubsection{Gelechiidae (twirler moths, leaf tiers)}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} Small (wingspan 7--25 mm); maxillary palps short, 4-segmented, located close to base of proboscis; labial palps long, upcurved, 3rd segment elongate and tapering; proboscis scaly; \textbf{apical-posterior margin of hind wing concave}.\\

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} Diversely phytophagous family, whose \textgreater4,500 described species mostly are generally found feeding internally on plants (e.g., in leaf mines and galls). This lineage includes many pest species, as well as moths that are important biocontrol agents against weeds.

\subsubsection{Tineidae (clothes moths and relatives)}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} Small to medium-sized (wingspan 7--36 mm), usually gray or brown; head vestiture bushy, mostly comprised of erect scales; antennae with a whorl of erect scales on each segment; maxillary palps usually present, folded; labial palps with sparse, elongate spines, usually very obvious; wing venation not so reduced as in above families.\\

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} Unlike most lepidopterans, species in this lineage mostly do \textit{not} feed on plants. Most species consume lichens, fungi, keratin (including feathers, mammal hair and horns), and detritus.\\

\subsubsection{Psychidae (bagworm moths)}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} Small to medium-sized moths (wingspan 12--36 mm); body usual black in North American species; wings often absent or reduced in females, which remain in the silken bag (Figure \ref{fig:psychid2}); male wings often (but not always!) mostly clear; setae hair-like, rather than scale-like.\\

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} Larvae typically form bags constructed of silk and plant material. Females usually have only vestigial wings and often remain inside these cases after pupation. Males are winged and only rarely colorful.

\subsubsection{Sesiidae (clearwing moths)}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} Small to medium-sized (wingspan 15--50 mm); transparent, scaleless ``windows'' usually present on wings; often wasp-like in shape and color; antennae widen apically, but narrow at the apex and are often somewhat hooked.\\

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} These moths are usually diurnal; can you guess why? Most species are wood or stem borers, and the taxon includes many pestiferous species.

\subsubsection{Cossidae (carpenterworm moths)}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} Relatively large (wingspan 40--100 mm), mottled gray and brown, heavy-bodied moths; male antennae bipectinate, females filliform; species in the U.S. usually black and gray, dull or with some orange; head is relatively small compared to the rest of the body (as opposed to Sphingidae).\\

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} There are almost 700 species worldwide, but only a handful occur in North America. Most species are borers, and a few are pests.

\subsubsection{Tortricidae (leafroller and fruitworm moths)}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} Small to medium-sized moths (wingspan 10--33 mm); labial palps usually project forward, maxillary palps small; portions of scales on head often flattened; apical margin of fore wings usually distinctive, broad; fore wings with complex color pattern relative to hind wings.\\

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} Diverse lineage, with \textgreater10,000 species, including many important pests. Larvae are diversely phytophagous, being leaf rollers, leaf tiers, fruit borers, gallers, \textit{etc}.

\paragraph{Rhopalocera (butterflies)} The next five families are all commonly referred to as butterflies (although Hesperiidae is sometimes excluded). They can be recognized by the following characters:
\begin{itemize}
\item antennae knobbed/hooked at tip
\item ocelli always absent
\item body usually small relative to wings, wings usually broad
\item hind wing with only 1 or 2 anal veins

\section{Trichoptera}

\noindent{}\textbf{Trichoptera} comprises approximately 13,000 species,  %http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2007f/zt01668p698.pdf
the vast majority of which are aquatic as larvae. Larvae exhibit diverse life history strategies and serve as important indicators of environmental health. For these reasons, we'll be examining larval specimens alongside adults. Larvae use silk extensively, often constructing static or portable shelters. Adult mouthparts are diagnostic for the order, being heighly reduced (haustellum) but with long palpi.

\subsection*{Big picture questions}

\noindent{}This is the most diverse aquatic taxon. What factors contribute to their overall diversity, compared to Odonata, Ephemeroptera, and Plecoptera?\\

\noindent{}Can you describe one or two characteristics that could be key innovations or opportunities?\\

\noindent{}With mouthpart modification another non-feeding related but vital function was lost. Can you describe an evolutionary novelty gained by trichopterans during the course of evolution that solves some problems associated with mandible reduction?\\

\noindent{}What trends do we see across the phylogeny of Trichoptera, with respect to feeding biology and silk use? \\

\noindent{}Familiarize yourself with the following taxon names, which refer to organisms you are likely to encounter in the northeastern USA and/or which are phylogenetically relevant. Can you describe how these arthropods live (natural history) and roughly how diverse they are? Do you know how they're related to one another? If you had to choose a taxon to study which one would it be and why?

\subsection{Hydroptilidae (micro-caddisflies)}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} antennae short, mesoscutum without warts, fore tibiae with 1 spur, very small (usually less than 5 mm), usually mottled grayish or brownish and very hairy.\\

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} These insects are among the smallest trichopterans, rarely measuring \textgreater5 mm as adults. Larvae are free-living until the final instar, which builds a silken structure referred to as a ``purse case''. Larvae feed on filamentous algae and/or diatoms.
