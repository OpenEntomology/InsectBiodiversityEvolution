  "body": "# Insect Biodiversity and Evolution\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThis course is aimed at educating late stage undergraduates and early stage graduate students. The learning outcomes are listed below. The instructors assume students have basic knowledge of genetics and evolution. This course has variably been referred to as Insect Taxonomy, Insect Systematics, Insect Classification, etc.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to collaboratively develop and improve the teaching materials—slideshows, handouts, lab exercises, etc.—for this kind of course, ultimately releasing them under a CC BY or similar license. As of this writing, however, these materials integrate content licensed under more restrictive CC licenses and copyrighted material used with permission or under fair use. \r\n\r\n# Insect Biodiversity and Evolution\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThis course is aimed at educating late stage undergraduates and early stage graduate students.

In the meantime, here are some details:\r\n\r\nFiles meant for developers/instructors are written with **Markdown** [https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#em](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#em)\r\n\r\nFiles intended for students are written **LaTeX** [https://www.latex-project.org/](https://www.latex-project.org/)\r\n\r\nExcept that slideshows are currently edited using **Google Slides** -- [https://www.google.com/slides/about/](https://www.google.com/slides/about/) -- although they might be moved to LaTeX\r\n\r\nCheck the course wiki for more info - [https://github.com/adeans/InsectBiodiversityEvolution/wiki](https://github.com/adeans/InsectBiodiversityEvolution/wiki) -\r\nand see github cheat sheet: [https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)\r\n\r\nSee also our course wiki: [https://github.com/OpenEntomology/InsectBiodiversityEvolution/wiki](https://github.com/OpenEntomology/InsectBiodiversityEvolution/wiki)\r\n\r\n## How to cite\r\n\r\nOpen Entomology Project (date) Insect Biodiversity and Evolution.
