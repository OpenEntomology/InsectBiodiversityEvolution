\section*{Introduction}\index{Acercaria}
Here we begin looking at taxa classified in \textbf{Acercaria}, a taxon characterized in part by the presence of stylate laciniae. These three orders, Hemiptera, Psocodea, and Thysanoptera, may comprise a monophyletic lineage that is sister to Holometabola (the taxon with truly larval immature stages). Alternatively, based on genome-scale molecular data \citep{Misof763}, these taxa are related as ((Thysanoptera, Hemiptera),(Psocodea, Holometabola)). Acercaria share the following characteristics \citep{beutel2013insect}; do they represent synapomorphies?

\begin{itemize}
\item legs with $\le$3 tarsomeres
\item cerci absent 
\item labial palps relatively small or absent 
\item maxilla modified into stylet (maxillary laciniae are separated from the rest of the maxilla and are stylet-like)
\item postclypeus relatively large, accommodates cibarial dilator muscles for sucking
\item many species with inactive stage prior to adult
\end{itemize}

\section{Hemiptera (true bugs, scale, aphids, hoppers, \textit{etc}.)}\index{Hemiptera}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} antenna usually with 5--10 antennomeres, sometimes reduced; piercing/sucking mouthpart (mandible and maxillae rod-like stylets); labium elongate, multi-segmented and surrounds the stylets posteriorly (beak); prothorax is usually wider than long; fore wing is sometimes more sclerotized than hind wing (\textit{e.g.}, Heteroptera); arolium (apicomedial membraneous area of pretarsus) balloon shaped, often exceeds tarsal claw apically, sometimes absent, not eversible; cercus absent.\vspace{3mm}

\subsection{Sternorrhyncha (psyllids, whiteflies, aphids, scale insects)}\index{Sternorrhyncha}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} tarsi 1- or 2-segmented; antennae filiform, sometimes absent labium arises from the head in between the procoxae when the head is in normal position, sometimes reduced; ovipositor reduced.\vspace{3mm}

\subsubsection{Psylloidea (plantlice)}\index{Psylloidea}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} tarsi 2-segmented; antennae usually with 10 antennomeres; fore wings often more sclerotized than hind wing; superficially resemble tiny cicadas.\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} More than 800 species of plantlice have been described worldwide, and several species are important pests (\textit{e.g}., \textit{Diaphorina citri} Kuwayama, 1908 and \textit{Trioza erytreae} Del Guercio, 1918, which both vector the bacterium that causes citrus greening).\vspace{3mm}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Aleyrodidae (whiteflies)}\index{Aleyrodidae}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} tarsi 2-segmented, antennae 7-segmented (figure \ref{fig:aleyrodid1}); hind wing almost as large as fore wings; wings held horizontally over body while at rest; body and wings covered with white, waxy powder (depending on preservation) (figure \ref{fig:aleyrodid2}).\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} More than 1,500 species are known worldwide, including many pest species. The typical whitefly life cycle is, at least superficially, similar to holometabolous development. Immature stages are even referred to as larvae, and the resting stage prior to eclosion of the adult is called the pupa or puparium (the resting stage resides inside the cast skin of an earlier instar).\vspace{3mm}

\begin{theo}
{}What is the function of the white ``powder'' that covers whitefly bodies? How would you test your hypothesis?

\subsubsection{Coccomorpha (scale insects, mealy bugs, \textit{etc}.)}\index{Coccomorpha}
\noindent{}The classification within this infraorder remains in flux, with possibly two superfamilies and more than 30 extant families. They share the following characteristics: adult males winged, 1-segmented tarsi (rarely 2), 1 pair of wings, no beak; females always wingless, sometimes legless or nearly so, often with a waxy or scale-like covering; first instar nymphs (``crawlers'') are quite mobile and have distinct legs and antennae.\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}These insects also live primarily sedentary lives, with virtually no locomotion after the first instar or ``crawler'' stage (at least for females). As you examine these scale specimens, think about their adaptations to this kind of lifestyle. Spend time with both the specimens we have \textit{in situ} (\textit{i.e.}, on a branch or leaf) and the slide-mounted specimens. For the latter specimens try to find the following structures, which are important for family-level diagnostics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item proboscis
    \item antennae
    \item legs
    \item anal opening
    \item adominal spiracles (may be absent in some taxa)
\end{itemize}

\noindent{}We'll look at one family, Diaspididae, which should give you a sense of the phenotypes used in diagnosing lower-level taxa.\vspace{3mm}

\subsubsection{Diaspididae (armored scale insects)}\index{Diaspididae}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} adult female flattened, disc-like with hard covering formed of wax and cast skins of earlier instars; antenna reduced to one segment; terminal abdominal segments form fused pygidium, anal opening without setae; legs absent.\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} A diverse family of scale insects, with well over 2,500 described species. Exuviae from early instars, along with plant material and even frass, are often incorporated into a protective ``shell'' that can be quite tough. Like other scale families, this one includes some important pests.\vspace{3mm}

\begin{theo}
{}Describe three adaptions you observed in these insects that allow them to live in one location for most of their lives. What challenges does this life history present? Given these challenges why don't they have many sclerites?
\end{theo} 

\subsubsection*{Aphidomorpha (aphids, adelgids, phylloxerans)}\index{Aphidomorpha}
This taxon includes four extant families, the largest of which is Aphididae (below), and many economically and ecologically important species. 

\subsubsection{Aphididae (aphids)}\index{Aphididae}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} tarsi 2-segmented, antennae usually 6-segmented; hind wing much smaller than fore wings; cornicles present near posterior end of abdomen (figure \ref{fig:aphid1}).\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} More than 4,000 species have been described worldwide, and at least 250 are known to be pests if the conditions are right. Diversity is higher in the temperate zone. These species have been studied extensively in the context of ecological and symbiotic interactions. They survive primarily as phloem-feeders.\vspace{3mm}

\subsection{Auchenorrhyncha (cicadas, hoppers)}\index{Auchenorrhyncha}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} head hypognathous, mouthparts arises posteroventrally from head; labium arises from the head anterior to the procoxae when the head is in normal position; antennae aristate; fore wing is not more sclerotized as hind wing; tarsi 3-segmented; presence of a complex tymbal acoustic system on abdominal segment 1; ovipositor well developed.\vspace{3mm}

\subsubsection*{Cicadomorpha}

\subsubsection{Cicadidae (cicadas)}\index{Cicadidae}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} relatively large (\textgreater{}2 cm); antennae arise between compound eyes that are widely separated (figure \ref{fig:cicadidae}); hind tibiae without large apical spur (\textit{i.e.}, a moveable projection); hind tibia without robust lateral and apical spines; tymbals present.\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} More than 1,300 species are known worldwide, and all are thought to be xylem-feeders (at least as immatures). Instars are subterranean, emerging only after several years' development. Imagoes are well-known for their courtship songs.\vspace{3mm}

\begin{theo}
{}Tymbals are present in all Auchenorrhyncha, but they are easy to see in Cicadidae due to their large size. Can you find and sketch them? Can you now find the hearing organ (tympanum)? Describe its location relative to the tymbal and think about why that might be.

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} Approximately 2,600 species have been described worldwide, most of which are understood to be xylem-feeders (unlike most other auchenorrhynchans, which are phloem-feeders). Nymphs ensconce themselves in a frothy, bubbly matrix of waste (``spittle''), where they are protected from many threats.\vspace{3mm}

\section*{Test yourself}
What traits exhibited by this lineage (Acercaria) might explain the multiple independent origins of hematophagy? Ancestral acercarians possibly fed on fungi; what did the transitions to feeding on blood look like? Why are no Sternorrhyncha parasitic on animals?\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}There remains some \sout{question} fading speculation regarding the monophyly of Acercaria. Think about the putative synapomorphies listed at the start of this section and the traits you observed in lab. Do you think these three orders are the only ones to evolve from a single common ancestor? If so, what did that ancestor look like?
