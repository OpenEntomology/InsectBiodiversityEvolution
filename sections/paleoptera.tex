\section*{Introduction}\index{Pterygota}\index{Pterygota}
In the insect phylogeny and fossil record we observe several adaptive radiations---\textit{i.e.}, events where the emergence of some key innovation or opportunity facilitated the rapid diversification of new forms. The emergence of wings is arguably the most important of these key innovations. The origin of these structures and the selective forces that acted on early versions of wings remain enigmatic. We will discuss hypotheses of the origin of wings before moving on to \textbf{Paleoptera} and the neopteran order \textbf{Plecoptera}.

\section*{Insecta: Pterygota}
We're now looking at insects that have \latinword{wings}, which are usually present as two pairs: fore wings, which articulate with the mesothorax, and hind wings, which articulate with the metathorax.\vspace{3mm}

\begin{theo}
{}Why is the thoracic integument so heavily sclerotized, relative to other body parts and those structures in non-pterygote hexapods? What are the consequences of this phenotype?
\end{theo}

\section*{Pterygota: Paleoptera}
In the next two orders, the wing base inhibits wing folding---\textit{i.e.}, the wings are held out or vertically over the thorax when at rest. The latest evidence indicates that these two orders comprise a monophyletic group, called Paleoptera.

\subsection{Naiads}
Mayflies are aquatic in their immature stages, which are usually referred to as naiads or larvae (Not to be confused with the immature stages of holometabolous insects; more on that later.) Mayflies spend the vast majority of their lives as naiads, and we can see numerous adaptations for feeding and locomotion in this stage. Examine naiads of the following families, which should give you a sense of the phenotypic variation in Ephemeroptera: \textbf{Baetidae}, \textbf{Heptageniidae}, and \textbf{Ephemeridae}.\\\index{Baetidae}\index{Heptageniidae}\index{Ephemeridae}

\section{Odonata (dragonflies, damselflies)}\index{Odonata}
Like their putative sister lineage, Ephemeroptera, immature Odonata are almost exclusively aquatic. All species are predaceous in all stages, with adaptations that facilitate prey tracking, stalking, and capture.\vspace{3mm}%add naiads and adults diag chars?

\begin{theo}
{}Can you list at least three adaptations you see across Odonata families that you hypothesize facilitate predation?\\

\noindent{}Odonata adults are prepared using an unorthodox approach, relative to other Pterygota (see Section \ref{odeprep}). Why?\index[preps]{Odonata}
\end{theo}\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}Another conspicuous synapomorphy for Odonata is the evolution of a secondary copulatory organ ventrally on the first abdominal segment of males. Females are grabbed and held behind the head by the male, using his apical abdominal appendages. Be sure to look for adaptations associated with this unusual copulatory habit.\vspace{3mm}

\begin{theo}
{}Sketch a feature on the female head that you suspect is an adaptation for this kind of copulation. How do you think the secondary male genitalia evolved? What did the early, intermediate form look like?
\end{theo}\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}Odonata is the first group where each wing has a distinct pterostigma (pigmented spot on anterior edge of wing). The pterostigma is not only highly pigmented but also more sclerotized and more massive than other wing areas.\vspace{3mm}

\section*{Pterygota: Neoptera}\index{Neoptera}
The remaining insect orders are classified in Neoptera, a lineage whose members can pull their wings over their abdomens when they're at rest. This movement is accomplished by flexing a pleural muscle that inserts on the 3rd axillary sclerite. The wing then folds along flexion lines that are not present in Paleoptera, allowing the wing to be pulled back posteriorly.\vspace{3mm}

\begin{theo}
{}In this unit we've touched on two evolutionary events that are considered to be \latinword{key innovations}: the origin of wings and the the origin of neoptery. Why do you think these two adaptations led to explosive diversification?
\end{theo}

\section{Plecoptera (stoneflies)}\index{Plecoptera}%add Pteronarcyidae (giant stoneflies) and Peltoperlidae (roach-like) need to sight ID?! why not ID the order and describe whether it has gill tufts and nota shape, glossa length, etc.
Like the previous two orders, Plecoptera are aquatic during their immature stages and semi-aquatic/terrestrial as adults. More than 100 million years of evolution separates Plecoptera from Paleoptera \citep{Misof763}, however, so stoneflies are not closely related (relatively speaking) to dragonflies and mayflies. It is useful to treat them here, however, as they have similar habits to mayflies, are important for monitoring water quality (like Ephemeroptera), and have inspired much speculation on the origin of wings.

\subsection*{Naiads}
Stonefly naiads are almost exclusively found in lotic environments---\textit{e.g.}, clear, clean, highly oxygenated streams---and they are generally very sensitive to water quality. The immature stages develop as predators of other aquatic invertebrates or as shredders of vegetative material. They can be recognized from other aquatic non-holometabolous insects by (a) the presence of two tarsal claws on each leg and (b) two cerci on the apex of the abdomen.\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}Select specimens of at least three families and look for phenotypic differences in these diagnostic traits:
\begin{itemize}
\item presence/absence of gill tufts on the thorax and/or abdomen
\item width and shape of nota in dorsal view
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Adults}
Stoneflies are generally not good dispersers and so are found near the features from which their naiads emerged. The diagnostic features can be subtle, so it's important to spend some time understanding the relevant morphology:

\begin{itemize}
\item Glossa length relative to paraglossa length (\textit{cf}.\footnote{From the Latin verb \textit{conferre}, to bring together, used here to invite the reader to compare the listed taxa.} Perlidae or Perlodidae \textit{vs}. Leuctridae or Capniidae)
\item Presence/location of gill remnants (\textit{cf}. Perlidae \textit{vs}. Perlodidae. Hint: look near the coxae)
\item Wing phenotype at rest (\textit{cf}. Perlidae or Perlodidae \textit{vs}. Leuctridae)
\item Wing venation (figure \ref{fig:plecowings})
\item Relative length of the cerci (\textit{cf}. Perlidae or Perlodidae \textit{vs}. Leuctridae)

\subsubsection{Capniidae (winter stoneflies)}\index{Capniidae}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} Glossae same length as paraglossae; cercus with at least 4 segments; gill remnants absent; cubito-anal crossvein arising distal to or from anal cell; 1--2 or more Cu crossveins on fore wing; 2A not forked.\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} Similar in size, habitus, and diversity to Leuctridae. Adults are active in winter. Naiads are lotic, primarily in the hyporheic zone (beneath the stream bed), and rarely collected.\vspace{3mm}

{}How did wings evolve? Did they develop \textit{de novo} or from existing structures? Why? Based on what you have learned in this course, what is the most plausible explanation for the origin of wings?

\section*{Test yourself}
If you were given a naiad (of the families we looked at in lab) could you identify it by sight? What about the adult form?\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}After listening to the class discussion, which hypothesis do you think most accurately explains the origin of wings in insects and why?\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}We talked about several adaptations one can see in paleopterans---for feeding, flying, mating, living in aquatic habitats, \textit{etc}. Which three are the most significant to you and why?
