\section*{Introduction}\index{Polyneoptera}
Polyneoptera (Insecta: Pterygota: Neoptera) is a superordinal lineage, often with the rank of ``cohort'', that only recently has been shown to be monophyletic. Do you see characters that might represent synapomorphies? (Hint: there aren't many, unfortunately, but look at the hind wings.) Keep in mind that Plecoptera belongs in Polyneoptera but was treated earlier in order to focus on its aquatic biology and the origin of wings/flight.

\section{Dermaptera (earwigs)}\index{Dermaptera}
\begin{itemize}
\item body dorsoventrally flattened
\item head prognathous
\item fore wings relatively short, heavily sclerotized, elytraform
\item hind wing fan-shaped
\item cerci forceps-like, each cercus comprised of a single segment
\item defensive glands open near 3rd and 4th abdominal tergites
\end{itemize}
Several families occur in North America, but we'll cover two. A single diagnostic character is sufficient to separate these two in lab, but you should key \citep{engelDerm} your specimens out to confirm their identity. You could easily collect one of the families we \textit{don't} cover in lab.\vspace{3mm}

\begin{theo}
{}What do you think the sclerotized cerci are used for? Why are the fore wings so short, leaving so much abdomen exposed?

\subsubsection{Spongiphoridae (little earwigs; includes Labiidae)}\index{Spongiphoridae}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} 2nd tarsomere cylindrical.\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} About eight species occur in North America, and the common, invasive \textit{Labia minor} (Linnaeus, 1758) can be found at lights with relative ease.\vspace{3mm}

\subsubsection{Forficulidae (European and spine-tailed earwigs)}\index{Forficulidae}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} 2nd tarsomere lobed apically.\vspace{3mm}

\section{Zoraptera}\index{Zoraptera}

\noindent{}Note that these insects are gregarious, and the overall phenotype of an individual depends on status of the aggregation.\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} Pale, eyeless, wingless OR pigmented (brown), with small compound eyes and wings (wings are dehiscent though!); wings with relatively simple venation; tarsus with 2 tarsomeres; cerci comprised of one apparent segment (\textit{i.e.}, no subdivisions).\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} There are two extant families---\textbf{Zorotypidae} and Spiralizoridae---with nearly 50 extant species worldwide. Zorapterans live in loose colonies in rotten wood (that must be \textit{just} right) and sawdust. Specimens are typically one of two forms: whitish, eyeless, wingless, and weakly sclerotized insects, or brownish, eyed, winged specimens (dispersal phase).\index{Zorotypidae}\vspace{3mm}

\section{Dictyoptera}\index{Dictyoptera}
This lineage is sometimes treated as comprising three orders, especially in the older literature: Blattaria or Blattodea (cockroaches), Isoptera (termites), and Mantodea (mantids). Recent phylogenetic work strongly suggests that termites are derived cockroaches, \textit{i.e.}, that ``Blattaria'' is paraphyletic. Cockroaches and termites are referred to collectively as Blattodea. These insects can be recognized by the following characters: fore wings (if present) tegmen-like, with many crossveins; male genitalia asymmetrical (reduced in termites); ovipositor extremely reduced, mostly internal; eggs deposited in proteinaceous matrix or envelope (ootheca) formed from excretions of the accessory glands (apparently lost in most termites).

\subsection{Blattodea}\index{Blattodea}
\subsubsection{Blattidae (American cockroach, \textit{etc}.)}\index{Blattidae}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} Fore wing (tegmen) more sclerotized than hind wing; female subgenital plate divided longitudinally; male styli similar to each other: slender, straight, elongate; spines on fore femur equal in length.\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} This family is subdivided into 46 genera, including two commonly found in/around buildings (peridomestic): \textit{Periplaneta} and \textit{Blatta}. These insects deposit their oothecae after they're made, often burying them. \vspace{3mm}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Ectobiidae (``Blattellidae''; German cockroach, \textit{etc}.)}\index{Ectobiidae}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} Female subgenital plate not divided; male styli usually small, asymmetrical; spines on fore femur decrease in size apically.\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} This family is subdivided into \textgreater200 genera, including many commonly found in/around buildings: \textit{e.g.}, \textit{Blattella} and \textit{Supella}. These insects often deposit their oothecae after they're made. Some species, however, hold onto them externally or even internally. This family is probably not monophyletic.\vspace{3mm}

\subsubsection{Cryptocercidae (hooded cockroaches)}\index{Cryptocercidae}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} Apex of abdomen covered by 7th tergite dorsally, 6th sternite ventrally; no subgenital plate; always wingless; middle and hind femora with few spines relative to other families.\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} These cockroaches are quite termite-like, with respect to their diet and interactions with conspecific individuals. In fact, Cryptocercidae is robustly sister to Isoptera. These cockroaches are described as being subsocial, with a common habitat (inside rotting wood) and considerable parental care of young.\vspace{3mm}

\subsubsection{Isoptera (termites)}\index{Isoptera}
\noindent{}\textit{Diagnostic characters:} Pronotum not shield-like (Compare to other Blattodea!); each tarsus subdivided into 4 tarsomeres (this character is difficult to see on dried specimens); cercus composed of 1--6 sclerites.\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} The presence of a fontanelle (pore) on the head is used to diagnose families, as is the number of sclerotized wing veins along anterior margin of fore wing (\textit{e.g.}, two or three present). Can you find these features in our specimens? For soldiers, can you count the number of teeth on the inner margin of the left mandible? All species are eusocial and live in colonies. Their primary food source is wood. The 3,000 or so described species are primarily tropical.\vspace{3mm}

\noindent{}\textit{Natural history:} All $\sim$2,400 species are predators, and the bulk of their diversity lies in the tropics. A tympanum, located between their legs, on the sternum, is hypothesized to be an adaptation for bat avoidance.\vspace{3mm}
