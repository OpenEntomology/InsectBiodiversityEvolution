<p>This course is aimed at educating late stage undergraduates and early stage graduate students. The learning outcomes are listed below. The instructors assume students have basic knowledge of genetics and evolution. This course has variably been referred to as Insect Taxonomy, Insect Systematics, Insect Classification, etc.</p>

<p>Our aim is to collaboratively develop and improve the teaching materials—slideshows, handouts, lab exercises, etc.—for this kind of course, ultimately releasing them under a CC BY or similar license. As of this writing, however, these materials integrate content licensed under more restrictive CC licenses and copyrighted material used with permission or under fair use. </p>

<h3>
<a id="learning-outcomes" class="anchor" href="#learning-outcomes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Learning outcomes</h3>

<p>Upon completion of this course students should be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Label a generalized hexapod diagram with external anatomy terms</li>
<li>Name and sight-identify all local hexapod orders and several common local families</li>
<li>Solve taxonomic problems and describe how species and other taxa are named and described, i.e., understand the fundamentals of taxonomic practice</li>
<li>Draw a phylogenetic tree of relationships between hexapod orders</li>
<li>Teach others how to read a phylogenetic tree and know what kinds of data are used to estimate trees, how those data are analyzed, and what it means to be monophyletic</li>
<li>Describe key innovations and life history strategies of major hexapod lineages</li>
<li>Teach others how to collect, preserve, and transport hexapod specimens and describe why this process is important</li>
<li>Teach others about the natural history of insects more generally</li>
</ul>

<p>We're developing a How to Contribute document that walks one through the steps. In the meantime, here are some details:</p>

<p>Files meant for developers/instructors are written with <strong>Markdown</strong> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#em">https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#em</a></p>

<p>Files intended for students are written <strong>LaTeX</strong> <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">https://www.latex-project.org/</a></p>

<p>Except that slideshows are currently edited using <strong>Google Slides</strong> -- <a href="https://www.google.com/slides/about/">https://www.google.com/slides/about/</a> -- although they might be moved to LaTeX</p>
