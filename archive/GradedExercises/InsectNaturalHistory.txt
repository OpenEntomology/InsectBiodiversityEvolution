Given this paper - http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biw043 - perhaps we need a natural history exercise.

(0) Student thinks about his/her background and interests. Based on these and a brief experiment (e.g., watch a spider web for 10 mins) s/he develops a proposed workflow or approach to observing and documenting insect natural history. What materials and supplies will s/he need? How will specimens be matched to observations in a notebook? What kinds of data will be collected? A proposal (1 pg) is written and given to a partner.

(1) Students vet each other's proposal and provide constructive feedback. A refined proposal is turned in for a grade.

(2) Instructors set up 4 m2 areas in different habitats. Students are told which ones they are to spend 4 hours observing/collecting/documenting the insects in it.

(3) Students are then told which one to move to for new observations.

(4) After 2 or 3 iterations student medidates on these observations, discusses them with partner, then chooses 2 or 3 (or 1?) observations s/he wants to develop knowledge on.

(5) The specimens from those key observations get determined to species, there is some literature search, and development of a presentation that is given eventually to the group.

(6) To complement this initial collection, which likely has low diversity relative to all possible insects that occur in PA, students dip into bulk samples taken from similar habitats (e.g., a Malaise trap set up in same meadow for a week). They each need to pull out insects that represent 20 families they didn't observe during their exercise.

(7) The entire collection and raw field notes are turned in, and the stories are presented to the class
