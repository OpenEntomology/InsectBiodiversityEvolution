\title{Insect Collector's Oath\footnote{This oath was modified from the modern version of the Hippocratic oath, written in 1964 by Louis Lasagna and available at: \url{http://www.aapsonline.org/ethics/oaths.htm\#lasagna} (accessed 18 January 2016)}}

\maketitle
\thispagestyle{empty}
\noindent{}I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability, the following ideals:

\begin{enumerate}
\item I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those entomologists in whose steps I walk, and gladly share my scientific gains and knowledge with those who are to follow.
\item I will aid in the dissemination of scientific knowledge, both to those who study insects and those who do not.
\item I will not discriminate against others, and I will strive to create a safe working environment, whether in the field, the classroom, or the lab.
\item I will treat insects humanely and with respect. As a collector, it is within my power to take insect life; I will not take insects that will not be deposited in a natural history collection or otherwise made available for research and education. While bycatch is often unavoidable, I will, to the best of my ability, attempt to limit the unnecessary loss of insect life and find use for these specimens.  
\item I will consider the ecological impact of removing insects from the environment when collecting, whether the species are protected by law, known to be declining, or are considered to be of least concern.
\item I will secure appropriate permits when needed, prior to collecting insects, and I will honor and uphold the provisions stated by each permit when collecting. I will keep copies of all permits on my person while collecting and furnish them to authorized agents upon request.
\item I will prepare and label specimens according to standards established by professional entomologists who work with collections. 
\item I will make available all field notes associate with the specimens I collect. 
\item I will properly store all specimens under my care, and I will not allow specimens to become damaged or degraded through neglect.
\item I will properly use and dispose of preservatives, killing agents, and other chemicals associated with specimen collection and preparation. I will never use these chemicals to harm myself or others.
\item I will not create false data.
\end{enumerate}
 
\noindent{}May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of natural history, and so long as I uphold  these traditions and the stated ideals, may I long experience the joy of my contributions to the furthering of scientific knowledge.
